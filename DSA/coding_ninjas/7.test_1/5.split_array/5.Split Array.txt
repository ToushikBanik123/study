Chapter TEST
Problem Statement: Split Array
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description:
Given an integer array A of size N, check if the input 
array can be splitted in two parts such that -
- Sum of both parts is equal
- All elements in the input, which are divisible by 5 should be in same group.
- All elements in the input, which are divisible by 3 (but not divisible by 5) should be in other group.
- Elements which are neither divisible by 5 nor by 3, can be put in any group.

Groups can be made with any set of elements, i.e. elements need not to be continuous. And you need to consider each and every element of input array in some group.
Return true, if array can be split according to the above rules, else return false.
Note : You will get marks only if all the test cases are passed.
Input Format :
Line 1 : Integer N (size of array)
Line 2 : Array A elements (separated by space)

Output Format :
true or false

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 50

Sample Input 1 :
2
1 2

Sample Output 1 :
false

Sample Input 2 :
3
1 4 3

Sample Output 2 :
true

Explanation for Sample 2:
- Elements divisible by 3 (not by 5): [3]
- Elements divisible by 5: []
- Elements neither divisible by 3 nor 5: [1, 4]
- We can split as: Group 1 = [3, 1] (sum = 4), Group 2 = [4] (sum = 4)

Sample Input 3 :
4
5 10 3 9

Sample Output 3 :
false

Explanation for Sample 3:
- Elements divisible by 5: [5, 10] (must be in same group, sum = 15)
- Elements divisible by 3 (not by 5): [3, 9] (must be in other group, sum = 12)
- Elements neither: []
- Cannot be split equally (15 ≠ 12), so we need flexible elements
- But we don't have any, so this should be FALSE

Sample Input 4 :
5
5 10 3 9 2

Sample Output 4 :
false

Explanation for Sample 4:
- Elements divisible by 5: [5, 10] (sum = 15)
- Elements divisible by 3 (not by 5): [3, 9] (sum = 12)
- Flexible elements: [2]
- Add 2 to group with 3,9: Group 1 = [5, 10] (sum = 15), Group 2 = [3, 9, 2] (sum = 14)
- Still not equal, so FALSE

Sample Input 5 :
5
5 10 3 9 3

Sample Output 5 :
true

Explanation for Sample 5:
- Elements divisible by 5: [5, 10] (sum = 15)
- Elements divisible by 3 (not by 5): [3, 9, 3] (sum = 15)
- Equal sums! TRUE

Sample Input 6 :
6
15 30 9 12 6 8

Sample Output 6 :
false

Explanation for Sample 6:
- Elements divisible by 15 (both 3 and 5): [15, 30] → Go to group with 5s
- Elements divisible by 5 only: [15, 30] (sum = 45)
- Elements divisible by 3 (not by 5): [9, 12, 6] (sum = 27)
- Flexible: [8]
- Add 8 to group with 3s: [9, 12, 6, 8] (sum = 35) vs [15, 30] (sum = 45)
- Still not equal, so FALSE

Sample Input 7 :
1
5

Sample Output 7 :
false

Explanation for Sample 7:
- Single element cannot be split into two equal groups

Sample Input 8 :
4
2 4 6 8

Sample Output 8 :
true

Explanation for Sample 8:
- All elements are flexible (not divisible by 3 or 5)
- Can split as: [2, 8] (sum = 10) and [4, 6] (sum = 10)

Sample Input 9 :
6
5 5 3 3 2 2

Sample Output 9 :
true

Explanation for Sample 9:
- Divisible by 5: [5, 5] (sum = 10)
- Divisible by 3 (not by 5): [3, 3] (sum = 6)
- Flexible: [2, 2]
- Add both 2s to group with 3s: [3, 3, 2, 2] (sum = 10) vs [5, 5] (sum = 10)
- Equal! TRUE

Sample Input 10 :
7
15 15 3 3 2 1 1

Sample Output 10 :
false

Explanation for Sample 10:
- Divisible by 5 (15 is divisible by both 3 and 5, goes to 5 group): [15, 15] (sum = 30)
- Divisible by 3 (not by 5): [3, 3] (sum = 6)
- Flexible: [2, 1, 1] (sum = 4)
- Add all flexible to 3 group: [3, 3, 2, 1, 1] (sum = 10) vs [15, 15] (sum = 30)
- Not equal, so FALSE

Sample Input 11 :
5
10 5 3 6 2

Sample Output 11 :
false

Explanation for Sample 11:
- Divisible by 5: [10, 5] (sum = 15)
- Divisible by 3 (not by 5): [3, 6] (sum = 9)
- Flexible: [2]
- If we add 2 to 3 group: [3, 6, 2] (sum = 11) vs [10, 5] (sum = 15) → Not equal
- Cannot split equally, so FALSE

Sample Input 12 :
8
5 10 15 3 6 9 1 7

Sample Output 12 :
false

Explanation for Sample 12:
- Divisible by 5 (including 15): [5, 10, 15] (sum = 30)
- Divisible by 3 (not by 5): [3, 6, 9] (sum = 18)
- Flexible: [1, 7] (sum = 8)
- Total sum = 56, need each group to have 28
- Group 1: [5, 10, 15] = 30 (need to reduce by 2)
- Group 2: [3, 6, 9, 1, 7] = 26 (need to add 2)
- But we cannot move elements between div5 and div3 groups - constraints violated
- FALSE
