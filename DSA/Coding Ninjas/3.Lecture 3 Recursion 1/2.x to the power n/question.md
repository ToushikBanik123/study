# x to the power n

## Problem Statement
Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.

**Level:** EASY

## Problem Description
- Calculate x^n using recursion
- Take x and n as input from user
- Return the computed result

## Input Format
Two integers x and n (separated by space)

## Output Format
x^n (i.e. x raised to the power n)

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ x ≤ 30
- 0 ≤ n ≤ 30

## Sample Test Cases

### Sample Input 1
```
3 4
```

### Sample Output 1
```
81
```

### Sample Input 2
```
2 5
```

### Sample Output 2
```
32
```

## Notes
- Must be implemented using recursion
- Handle edge cases (n = 0, n = 1)
