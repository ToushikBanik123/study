Chapter Assignment
Problem Statement: Return Permutations - String
Problem Level: HARD
Problem Description:

Given a string S, find and return all the possible permutations 
of the input string.
Note 1 : The order of permutations is not important.
Note 2 : If original string contains duplicate characters, 
permutations will also be duplicates.
Input Format :
String S

Output Format :
All permutations (in different lines)

Sample Input :
abc

Sample Output :
abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba

=====Additional Test Cases=====

Test Case 1: Single character
Input: a
Output: a
Expected Permutations: 1

Test Case 2: Two characters
Input: ab
Output:
ab
ba
Expected Permutations: 2

Test Case 3: Duplicate characters
Input: aa
Output:
aa
aa
Expected Permutations: 2 (both same)

Test Case 4: Three characters with duplicates
Input: aab
Output:
aab
aba
aab
aba
baa
baa
Expected Permutations: 6 (with duplicates)

Test Case 5: Empty string
Input: (empty string)
Output: (empty string)
Expected Permutations: 1

Test Case 6: Four characters
Input: abcd
Output: 24 permutations
abcd, abdc, acbd, acdb, adbc, adcb,
bacd, badc, bcad, bcda, bdac, bdca,
cabd, cadb, cbad, cbda, cdab, cdba,
dabc, dacb, dbac, dbca, dcab, dcba
Expected Permutations: 24

Test Case 7: All same characters
Input: aaa
Output:
aaa
aaa
aaa
aaa
aaa
aaa
Expected Permutations: 6 (all same)

Test Case 8: Numbers as string
Input: 123
Output:
123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321
Expected Permutations: 6

Test Case 9: Mixed case letters
Input: Aa
Output:
Aa
aA
Expected Permutations: 2

Test Case 10: Five characters (stress test)
Input: abcde
Expected Permutations: 120 (5!)

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n! * n) where n is the length of string
- n! permutations and O(n) to generate each
Space Complexity: O(n! * n) to store all permutations
- n! permutations, each of length n

Edge Cases Covered:
1. Empty string
2. Single character
3. Duplicate characters
4. All same characters
5. Different character types
6. Larger strings for performance testing
